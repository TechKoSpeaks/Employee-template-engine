# Employee Template Generator

## Description

This is an app for building a software engineering team generator using the command line application. This application utilizes object oriented programming, where the tests are built prior to the code to ensure functionality. This app prompts the user for information about a team manager, and then information about the team members. The user can input any number of team members, and they may be a mix of engineers and interns, and all must pass unit tests. When the user has completed building the team, the application generates an HTML file that displays a nicely formatted team roster based on the information provided by the user.
